Our UC Davis educated, Burgundy trained winemaker, Tom Fitzpatrick, believes that a wine should be an "expression of place, at a moment in time" and should therefore capture the unique personality of a site as it is expressed in each vintage. Terroir-driven wines that reflect this philosophy are our focus.',
